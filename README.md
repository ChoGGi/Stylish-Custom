# Current issue(s)

```
when you update all styles from the manage window;
you need to either close then reopen it or save a style to see changes.

If you use new search and you hide the search bar in the customize window,
then close the edit window, open it, and then re-add the search bar:
it'll be hidden till you reopen the edit window.
```
