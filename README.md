Stylish-Custom for Stylish v1.4.3:
https://choggi.org/misc/Stylish-Custom/Stylish_v1.4.3

There is also Stylish Editor Modified:
https://addons.palemoon.org/extensions/appearance/stylish-editor-modified/
You could try having them both installed, but you are on your own for any issues/bugs.
```
### Current issue(s):

```
The Style Info window can only be manually updated.

If you use new search and you hide the search bar in the customize window,
then close the edit window, open it, and then re-add the search bar:
it'll be hidden till you reopen the edit window.

If you use replace once with the caret after the search text it just skips forward instead of wrapping.
```
